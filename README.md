# Proyecto_Sprint7

This repository contains the source files to be launched on a web server (render.com) with the following link:
https://project-sprint-7-njo2.onrender.com

This project shows some graphics (slider, box plot, line plot, histogram) to display only the results of a data analysis, by using Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, SciPy and SQL.

This is part of an exercise.
